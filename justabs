The discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson is one of the primary physics objectives of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
This thesis describes a search carried out for the SM Higgs boson on data collected during the 2011 and 2012 proton-proton (pp) collision 
runs with the CMS detector corresponding to integrated luminosities of $5.1 fb^{-1}$ and $5.3 fb^{-1}$ respectively.
A detailed description of the search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to two photons 
from the full dataset collected at CMS during the 2011 pp collision run is provided. 
In particular, the development of signal and background modelling techniques used for statistical interpretations of the data are highlighted.
Results of the search using these techniques from the 2011 dataset are presented. 
In addition, an update to the analysis including data taken during 2012 is described and the 
results from the combined 2011 and 2012 analyses given.
Results from the combination of several Higgs decay channels at CMS are reported, including those presented in
the International Conference on High Energy Physics in July 2012 at which the announcement of discovery was made.
Ongoing studies to ascertain the properties of the new particle are discussed and preliminary results from the combined 
7 and 8 TeV datasets (corresponding to $5.1fb^{-1}$ and $12.2fb^{-1}$ respectively) are presented.
